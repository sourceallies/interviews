# C# Technical Interview

We're excited to pair with you on a coding kata!

You will use this solution to write your code and tests to solve the problem of the kata below. We will gradually add requirements as we move through the problem and get a feel of what it's like to work with you in a real-world situation. Take your time, explain your thinking, and have fun with us! Show off your skills and ask any questions you have and we'll do the same.
